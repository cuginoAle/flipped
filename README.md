# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Flipped

This component implements the [FLIP technique](https://aerotwist.com/blogflip-your-animations/) created by [Paul Lewis](https://aerotwist.com/blog/)

The component

```jsx
<Flipped>...</Flipped>
```

is a simple wrapper to anything you want to transition when the UI gets re-rendered.
